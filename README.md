# D3-challenge
I created a scatter plot between two of the data variables Smokers vs. Age.

Using the D3 techniques I learned in class, I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I coded this graphic in the app.js file of my homework director, and I made sure to pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. My scatter plot appears like the image at the top of this section.

I included state abbreviations in the circles.

I created and situated my axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

Note: I used python -m http.server to run the visualization.
